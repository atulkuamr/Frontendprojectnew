			<h3>When I click a deal on your site it tells me that the price has gone up! What's up with that?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Because we're searching hundreds of other travel sites at once, sometimes there are accuracy issues with the information we're trafficking in 
                from those sites. Either the site isn't updating their inventory with us, has given us the wrong path or another traveller has booked the last available option.</p>
			</div>
			<h3> Help! I need to change/cancel my reservation!</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Help is on the way: if you booked your travel on the JustClickKaro site with one of our providers, then you can go to Bookings and get info on 24/7 support. 
                If you booked your travel outside of Travstarz Global Group or were redirected from our site to a provider's web page to complete your booking, then you'll need to 
                touch-base with the provider directly. Not sure who your provider is? Check your credit card statements to see who charged your card.
                </p></div>

			<h3>  What is Travstarz Global Group's refund policy?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Because Travstarz Global Group is a search engine, not a seller, we don't have a refund policy -- that's handled solely by the provider that booked your trip. 
                Not sure what company to talk to? Check your credit card statement and/or go to Bookings to locate your provider's information.</p>
                 </div>

            <h3> How do I create a Price Alert?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>So many ways. On a desktop, you can create one by signing in and going directly to Price Alerts in your account, or you can look for the 'Create a Price Alert' 
                button on the top left-hand side of the flight and hotel search results. If you're on our app, you can get to Price Alerts by using the app's navigation menu and 
                following the instructions there.</p>
                </div>

            <h3>Where do the star ratings for hotels come from?</h3>
			<div>
			<p>Star ratings are provided by the hotels themselves as well as online travel agencies that sell hotel rooms. Travstarz Global Group takes that information and displays what's
             most accurate. We understand that some of these providers are more reliable than others and take this into account when displaying the number of stars.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Can I trust a hotel's review rating? Where are you getting those reviews?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>All of our hotel reviews are by verified guests, so you know that what you're reading is legit (and not the hotel porter's extended family trying to help boost reservations).</p> 
         
                </div>

            <h3>How do I get my hotel to show up on Travstarz Global Group?</h3>
			<div>
